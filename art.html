      <h1>Jerome's Artwork</h1>
      <p>
        Since I was young I've always had some creative outlet. Inspired by the
        rennaisance men I learned about in middle school, it's been my life goal
        to not only be well versed in technology but in the arts as well. This
        has taken many forms over the years, though woodworking will always hold
        a special place in my heart. I hope you enjoy looking through some of my
        recent work!

        <h2>Yin Yang Side-table</h2>
        <p>
          My most recent work is this Yin Yang side table that I made from a
          bunch of wooden pallets my friend had laying around. I chopped up the
          pallets and painstakingly re-surfaced each piece of the table before
          glueing and cutting it to size. Over 6 hours were spent sanding it
          down to 1000 grit sandpaper. I bent and welded the legs as well.

        <h2>Unintelligent Wooden Toilet</h2>
        <p>
          In my sculpture class we were tasked with creating an everyday object
          out of wood. After giving it some thought, I decided to do a toilet as
          a challenge. I created a mock up out of some scrap wood and measured
          each and every angle. Once that was done I fabricated each bowl-piece
          eight times. Then came the fun part of glueing, nailing, and screwing
          it all together!

        <h2>Shell-chime from recycled wood</h2>
        <p>
          To create this piece I started with an old log. I carefully removed
          the bark with a chisel and then got to sanding down any marks i put
          in the grain to give it a drift-wood look. I then cut the log down in
          half and bent some aluminum wire I had into hooks. Then I drilled
          holes and secured the hooks with loctite. I then strung up the shells
          and secured the rope. It sounds great!
