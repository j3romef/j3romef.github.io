    <h1>Jerome's Car History</h1>
    <p>Since I was a kid I always loved cars. Whether it was going to the yearly car show or sitting shotgun while my dad floored the Porsche, something had me hooked.</p>

    <p>I progressed as any kid would going from racing hotwheels, to the pinewood derby, to rc cars, and finally the real deal.</p>

    <p>The cars I have owned are as follows in order from first to last.</p>

    <h3>2008 Volkwagen Passat</h3>

    <p>The 2008 Volkswagen Passat will always hold a special place in my heart. Though it was a family car I got to drive it my senior year of highschool.</p>

    <p>The car seats five but can easily hold 8 as my highschool cross country buddies can attest to. It doesn't claim great off road capabilities but functions surprisingly well off the pavement.</p>

    <p>My biggest complaint about the car was the gas mileage. A sedan getting 17 miles per gallon (my personal mpg) is rough on a highschooler's wallet.</p>

    <p>The 2008 Passat unfortunately met its demise when I rear ended someone at a yeild sign :(. Thought the damages weren't terrible it was an old car and thus was totaled by insurance.</p>

      <li>207 lb-ft @1800 rpm</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2020 Volkswagen Jetta</h3>

    <p>The 2020 Volkswagen Jetta came about a couple months later. I was in the market for a new car and split the cost of this car with my parents. I now had skin in the game.</p>

    <p>The Jetta is designed to be a A to B car much like a Honda Civic and performed fantastically for that purpose. The manual gearbox did offer some freedome, yet I felt very limited.</p>

    <p>The 147 horsepower engine leaves some power to be desired, but I still pushed that thing pretty hard.</p>

    <p>It did however sip gasoline and I regularly got 40-50 miles per gallon on the highway. I delivered pizza and doordash in the Jetta and it worked perfectly for that purpose.</p>

    <p>I lost the Jetta in an accident on Red Road by campus, when I got distracted by a pedestrian and rear ended the person in front of me when he suddenly braked.</p>

    <h4>2020 Volkswagen Jetta</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>1.4 l Inline 4 Cylinder Engine</li>
